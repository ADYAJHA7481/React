# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# React
 React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering, making it ideal for single-page applications.


Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
